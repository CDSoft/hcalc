My plans for some future releases
=================================

- Specification with hSpec 
- or user manual with embedded tests as specification to show a trivial traceability

Or implement both :

- hSpec
- a document that test Interface.hs
    - a test function that takes a possible interaction and tests it
    - the document is a user manual
    - and can execute tests and measure the code coverage
